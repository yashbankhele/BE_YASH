ü§ñ Machine Learning Practicals ‚Äì AI & Data Science (BE, 7th Semester)
This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of practical implementations for various Machine Learning concepts. The projects cover core topics including Feature Transformation, Regression, Classification, Clustering, Ensemble Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Each practical is implemented in Python using industry-standard libraries like pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and seaborn.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Feature Transformation ‚Äì PCA
Objective: Reduce the dimensionality of a wine dataset to capture maximum variance and simplify the distinction between red and white wines.

Dataset: Wine Dataset

Implementation:

Standardized numerical features.

Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

Visualized the first two principal components to effectively separate the wine types.

Outcome: The reduced feature space successfully preserved most of the dataset's variance, simplifying subsequent analysis.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Analysis ‚Äì Uber Ride Price Prediction
Objective: Predict Uber ride fares based on pickup and drop-off locations using various regression models.

Dataset: Uber Fares Dataset

Implementation:

Preprocessed data, handled missing values, and removed outliers.

Checked feature correlations.

Trained and evaluated Linear, Ridge, and Lasso Regression models.

Evaluated models using R 
2
 , RMSE, and MAE.

Outcome: The best-performing regression model was identified, providing a robust solution for fare prediction.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Classification Analysis ‚Äì SVM for Handwritten Digits
Objective: Classify handwritten digits (0‚Äì9) with high accuracy using a Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Dataset: sklearn.datasets.load_digits()

Implementation:

Flattened image data into feature vectors.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

Trained an SVM with an RBF kernel.

Evaluated accuracy using a confusion matrix.

Outcome: The SVM model achieved high accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in image classification tasks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Clustering Analysis ‚Äì K-Means on Iris Dataset
Objective: Group similar flowers from the Iris dataset using K-Means Clustering.

Dataset: Iris Dataset

Implementation:

Standardized features.

Applied K-Means Clustering.

Determined the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method.

Visualized the resulting clusters with scatter plots.

Outcome: The model effectively grouped the flowers, with the clusters closely matching the actual species patterns.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Ensemble Learning ‚Äì Random Forest for Car Safety
Objective: Predict the safety rating of cars using an Ensemble Learning approach with a Random Forest Classifier.

Dataset: Car Evaluation Dataset

Implementation:

Preprocessed data and encoded categorical features.

Trained a Random Forest Classifier.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.

Outcome: The ensemble model provided accurate car safety predictions, highlighting the power of combining multiple decision trees.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Reinforcement Learning ‚Äì Maze Exploration
Objective: Implement a Reinforcement Learning agent to autonomously navigate a virtual maze.

Implementation:

Defined the states, actions, and rewards of the maze environment.

Applied the Q-Learning algorithm.

Visualized the optimal path learned by the agent.

Outcome: The agent successfully learned the most efficient path through the maze by optimizing its actions based on rewards and penalties.
